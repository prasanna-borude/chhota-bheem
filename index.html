        <p>Dholu and Bholu are identical twins and followers of Kalia.
         Though they are not strong themselves, they bask in Kalia's strength. Despite their support for a bully,
          they have kind hearts and have also won a trophy for their close brotherhood. 
         But sometimes, they argue among themselves and get scolded by Kalia.
